# php-scripts
This repository contains a collection of PHP practice projects and scripts that I have created to improve my skills in the language. 

The projects range from simple scripts to more complex applications, and cover a variety of topics such as object-oriented programming, web development, and database integration. The scripts and projects can be used as a learning resource for anyone interested in PHP, and are open to contributions and suggestions.
